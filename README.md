## Methodology
This project was split between 6 modules of coursework and several iterations to the systems model for a package delivery drone. Development followed the traditional systems engineering method with frequency refinements as feedback was obtained.The systems engineering method involves four basic steps:

  * Requirements analysis - identifies why requirements are needed
  * Functional definition - translates requirements into functions
  * Physical definition - synthesizes alternative physical implementations
  * Design validation - models the system environment
  
These four steps are applied repetitively in each phase during development. Application of the systems engineering method evolves over the life cycle - as the system progressively materializes, the focus shifts from system-level during needs analysis down to component and part levels during engineering design.
